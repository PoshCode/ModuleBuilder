# How to create a new module #

 1 - Import Module-Builder - Resolve-Alias should now load with it.
 
 2 - Then run Create-Module - The clobber with New-Module is fixed.
 
 3 - InitializeGit - Password or Personal Access Token, but passwords get asked more often...
 
 4 - Now I guess you get to choose your own testing and deployment framework...
 
 5 - Because for the final stretch, script signing is here! Yay!
 
 
 Go wild!
